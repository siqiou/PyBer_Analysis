## Summary:
Base on the findings, we are proposing 3 business recommendations to PyBer CEO:
1. Urban cities total rides are 13 times more than Rural cities, there are more business opportunities, but drivers tend to make less money per ride, and they have to get more ride orders if they want to earn more.
2. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver is highest in Rural cities, this indicates that people there tend to take longer trips, which means higher profitability, it is recommended to offer longer trips but less drivers in this type of city.
3. Suburban cities' highest average weekly fare are almost the same as Urban cities' lowest average weekly fare, and the average fare by driver is more than double of Urban cities', there are opportunities for drivers to make more money in Suburban cities.
